Some introduction containing historical information and stuff, and motivation for this section. 

\section{Quantum Mechanics}

In ordinary quantum mechanics an observable is a linear operator acting on a Hilbert space. Position operator and momentum operator, other observable quantities like angular momentum, energy, and so on, are linear operators constructed out of linear combinations of products of the position and momentum.\cite{kvaal}

\section{Canonical quantization}

Moving from a classical Hamiltonian description to a non-relativistic quantum mechanical description of the particle through a procedure called canonical quantization.(ref. Simen Kvaal)

Canonical communtation relations 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:commutation}
\{q_k, p_l\} = \delta_{kl}
\end{equation}

Any coordinate system $\epsilon = (q,p)$ we wish to use that satisfies \ref{eq:commutation} can be called canonical. (ref. Simen Kvaal)

Classical state: point in phase space

Quantum state: complex-valued wave function in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, i.e. a complete vector space with an inner product.
Standard choice of Hilbert space is the space of square integrable function, $L^2$, where the wave function $\psi$ is a function depending on all coordinates:

\begin{equation}
\psi = \psi (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_N)
\end{equation}

where $(x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_N) \in X^N$ is a point in the configuration space of N particles. 

The wave function is a map 

\begin{equation}
\psi : X^N \longrightarrow \mathbb{C}
\end{equation}

An observable is a $\textit{self-adjoint operator}$ (Hermitian operator) $\hat{\Omega}$, and its value in the state $\psi$ is the expectation value. 

Expectation value: 

\begin{equation}
\expval{\Omega} = \expval{\hat{\Omega}}{\psi} = \int \psi (x_1, \cdots , x_N)\ast [\hat{\Omega} \psi (x_1, \cdots, x_N)] dx_1 \cdots dx_N
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ket{\psi(t)} = \hat{H} \ket{\psi(t)}
\end{equation}

Replace classically canonical coordinates $\epsilon = (q, p)$ with operators $(\hat{q}, \hat{p})$ such that

\begin{equation}
\{q_j, p_k\} = \delta_{jk} \Rightarrow [\hat{q_j}, \hat{p_k}] = i \hbar \delta_{jk}
\end{equation}

\section{Canonical transformation}

A one-to-one algebra morphism of an observable, u, onto itself leaving the canonical commutation relations invariant. The canonical transformation is a map, $u \rightarrow u$ 

properties satisfying 

-linearity
-invariance
-product conserving (s. 175 MBBS)

\section{Second quantization}

Now the particles themselves are discrete quanta created and destroyed with creation and annihilation operators

Position operator 

\begin{equation}
[\hat{r_i} \psi](x_1, \cdots, x_N) = r_i \psi (x_1, \cdots, x_N) 
\end{equation}

Momentum operator 

\begin{equation}
[\hat{p_i} \psi](x_1, \cdots, x_N) = -i \hbar \nabla_i \psi (x_1, \cdots, x_N) 
\end{equation}
